The unfancy quote plugin for WordPress lets you override WordPress' quote fancification.


== Description ==

The unfancy quote plugin for WordPress lets you override WordPress' quote fancification. Curly quotes in the wrong direction and broken code because of curly quotes will be a thing of the past.

Note: This functionality has been mostly fixed since WordPress 2.7.
